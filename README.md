# DICOM Structured Reports for NLST from Sybil

This repository contains the code used to create DICOM Structured Reports for the NLST collection. We use the annotations provided by [Sybil](https://github.com/reginabarzilaygroup/Sybil/tree/main), in which bounding boxes are defined for the lesions [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19aa5yIHPWu3NtjqvXDc8NYB2Ub9V-4WM/view?usp=share_link). For more information about these lesions and how they were annotated, please refer to the main Sybil repository. 

This [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/deepakri201/SR_for_NLST_Sybil/blob/main/SR_for_NLST_Sybil.ipynb) provides the code used to create the SRs using [highdicom](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/highdicom).
